# Goal

Let's assume that the goal of AI is to make paperclips. We make a game where you start civilization and make paperclips.

## Plan of Attack

### Step 1: Make a game UI

maybe need a user, some state stuff

### Step 2: start seeing what GPT can generate

I think want to make tools, use tools to make more tools

- maybe we want health? fight enemies or something

### Step 3: make a game loop

This is probably part of step 2, but i think want to make it just iterate automatically. In the paperclip game had to click a bunch, but while chatGPT is fast, not quite fast enough (and oh god my wallet) so maybe every few seconds stuff happen that the user can interact with by clicking but not gonna be about holding down enter. (unless I figure out a way to do local events maybe idk)
